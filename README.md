# Cloudify
Note: I don't promote piracy. I made this Web application to learn about MERN Stack. So I don't take responsibility for how you will use this app.

Cloudify is a cloud-based torrent downloader made using Seedr API and [Torrent Search API](https://github.com/Ryuk-me/Torrent-Api-py). It is just an additional layer that I added so that we can easily add a torrent file without going to the torrent search engine and pasting the magnet link in seedr.

To set up this project you need to create a .env file containing APP_PORT and ACCESS_TOKEN of seedr API. After creating the .env file you need to set up the server file for basic API setup. Then, you have to install the front-end part which is made through create-react-app.

A few features are still pending that I am going to implement soon.
